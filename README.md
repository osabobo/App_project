# Project Title: Detection of fraud in uganda

##Project Description: Given the final narrative report of the Anti-Corruption Country Threshold (ACT) program in Uganda, the goal is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) model that can automatically extract and summarize key program objectives, achievements, successes, and shortcomings across its various components. This model could be used to assist program evaluators and policymakers in quickly identifying areas of success and improvement, as well as informing future anti-corruption initiatives in Uganda and beyond.
